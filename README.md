# F1 weather impact analysis
This project reads the skies over Monza to find out whether rain can change the game. <br/>

# About this project 
Using historical weather data and race outcomes, this project analyzes how temperature, humidity, and rainfall influence race performance. We draw correlations between weather conditions and driver results, helping us understand when weather is a game-changer.<br/>

# Features 
🌦️ Weather data download and cleaning<br/>
📊 Correlation analysis between weather variables and race outcomes<br/>
⚡ Predictive model to simulate race impacts under specific conditions<br/>
📁 Insights and predictions in CSV<br/> 

# Tech stack
- Python, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib<br/>
- scikit-learn<br/>
- Historical F1 and weather datasets<br/>
- Streamlit<br/>

# How it works
1. Load and clean weather data<br/>
2. Merge it with the race results for Monza<br/>
3. Analyze key metrics like humidity, temperature, and rain<br/>
4. Build and evaluate classification models<br/>
5. Export final predictions<br/>
